🧠 Exploring Mental Health in Tech Company — My Tableau Dashboard Project
Part of my ITI Journey✨.

Over the past few days at the ITI, I’ve worked on a project that gave me more than just technical skills—it gave me perspective.

Using real survey data, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard to explore mental health in professional environments. The results were eye-opening.

📊 What the data revealed:
🔹 61.3% of participants reported facing mental health challenges.
 Yet only 49% actually sought help. That means many people are quietly struggling—possibly due to stigma, fear, or lack of resources.

🔹 Mental health leave is still a privilege.
 Most employees said taking time off for mental health is either very difficult or not supported.
This can lead to “presenteeism,” where people show up to work but can’t perform at their best.

🔹 Company-provided support is lacking.
 🚫 793 participants said their company does not offer mental health care options.
 ✅ Only 433 said support is available—highlighting a real need for action.

🔹 Gender & Industry Patterns
👨 79% of respondents were male, 👩 21% female — possibly reflecting tech industry gender ratios.
🧑‍💻 81.73% work in tech, with 70% on-site.
 ➡️ This raises questions about how high-pressure work environments and lack of flexibility might be affecting mental health.

🔹 Talking to Supervisors
 Interestingly, over 800 people said they would speak to their supervisors about mental health.
 📌 That’s a good sign — but only if those leaders know how to respond with empathy and support.

🔹 Company Size vs Mental Health Impact
 Even in companies with 500+ employees, many reported mental health consequences.
 This shows that size and resources don’t automatically mean a healthier work environment.

🔹 Data Collection Trends
 📅 Most responses were submitted in August, a period that may coincide with work stress peaks, performance reviews, or seasonal mental health shifts.

 🎯 Goal:
To raise awareness and give organizations a clearer picture of where mental health support is falling short—and how they can start improving it.
